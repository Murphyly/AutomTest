  Software Testing is a process which aims to find defects
  during a software lifecycle. It involves time-consuming
  activities and may be impossible to guarantee the
  softwareâ€™s perfect functioning due to the numerous cases
  that must be processed accurately. The software must
  ensure compliance with functional requirements, but most
  current test case generation tools lack functionalities
  based on functional requirements. Therefore, they often
  point to defects that may not match software requirement
  specifications or report cases considered defects
  according to these specifications. In this scenario, to
  support functional requirements testing processes by
  generating requirement-based tests,
